    "prompt": "Candid environmental portrait of a professional young woman founder in a modern startup workspace. She is mid-action, focused and engaged, hands gesturing as if in discussion, surrounded by authentic startup details: coffee cup, laptop with stickers, natural workspace clutter. The scene is naturally lit with cool daylight and subtle indigo-violet tones in shadows, suggesting late afternoon energy. Composition is off-center, showing depth with workplace context—windows, desk, and soft background activity. Attire is casual-professional (t-shirt or hoodie), expression is confident and in-flow, not posed. Diversity in features, authentic and unpolished. No screens, no text, no posters, no whiteboards visible.",

Composition is shoulder-level, subject off-center with clear depth: foreground objects, subject, softly blurred background. Attire is casual-professional, genuine founder vibe. No direct eye contact with camera, expression is determined and absorbed. No screens, no text, no posters, no whiteboards visible.",
